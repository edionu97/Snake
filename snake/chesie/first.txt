Dear player,I'm very glad that in your free time you choosed to play this game...
I know that you allready know how to play this game,but you need to know some tips for this one :)) ...
As you know,you could move your snake up,down,left,right and as you eat some food it's size will increase,but sometimes
on your screen will appear a black sqare and eating it could give you speed,or could take it,can increase your size,or decrease it and more stuff that I let you discover...
For movement you should know this:
	ALT + W : up
	ALT + S : down
	ALT + A : left
	ALT + D : right
But you could also use mouse to press the buttons that are showed in the left size of the window

YOUR JURNEY BEGINS !!!!
